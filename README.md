<h1>Tip Calculator</h1>
<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<p>
  If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.<br>
  Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6<br>
  Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60<br>
  Thus everyone's share of the total bill is $30.00 plus a $3.60 tip.<br>
